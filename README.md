# Jio Sava – Music Web App

Jio Sava is a modern, lightweight music web application inspired by popular streaming platforms like JioSaavn and Spotify. It features a clean, dark-themed user interface designed to provide an intuitive and enjoyable music listening experience directly in the browser.

This project demonstrates core web development skills including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating an interactive music player UI. Users can play, pause, and listen to tracks with a custom-designed player interface that includes album artwork, song titles, and control buttons.

The goal of Jio Sava is to provide a simple yet visually appealing front-end prototype of a music streaming app that can be further extended with playlists, song libraries, and more advanced features like user authentication and API integration.
